      <h2>Generating the path</h2>
      <p class="fs-5 my-5 text-start">
        The first step in Path Length was to randomize the paths used. They were
        split up into sections, each of which was either a straight line, a
        corner, or a semicircle, then given a random width (or a corresponding
        width, if the bottom path was being generated).
      </p>
      <div class="px-5">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/sadeshmukh/cd3bc62688d6af5b277e39366903ee72.js?file=generatePath.js"></script>
        <label>function generatePath() from public/js/path_length.js</label>
      </div>

      <h2 class="mt-3">Drawing the path</h2>
      <p class="fs-5 my-5 text-start">
        After generating the path, the next step was to actually draw it. For
        straight lines and corners, it was fairly straightforward, drawing a
        line directly to the end point or along each axis. However, when it came
        to drawing semicircles, a trouble arose. Drawing the semicircle itself
        isn't hard - all that needs to be done is to use
        <code>canvas.context.arc()</code> at the center of the circle. Where the
        trouble comes is how to angle the arc right, which involves a bit more
        math.
      </p>
      <div class="px-5">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/sadeshmukh/cd3bc62688d6af5b277e39366903ee72.js?file=drawSemicircle.js"></script>
        <label
          >case "semicircle" from function drawPath() in
          public/js/path_length.js</label
        >
      </div>
      <p class="fs-5 my-5 text-start">
        To angle it right, I used <code>Math.atan()</code> to find this angle,
        which you can see below. You may have noticed a few
        <code>Math.PI</code> calls, since all functions use radians instead of
        degrees. Adjusting the angle by half of PI or PI, I was able to rotate
        the arc into the correct position.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-5">Calculating path lengths</h2>
      <p class="fs-5 my-5 text-start">
        To detect the correct path length, I had a function which would loop
        over each section of the path and use the correct formula (pythagorean
        theorem, adding, pi × radius) per section to find the total length of
        the path.
      </p>
      <div class="px-5">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/sadeshmukh/cd3bc62688d6af5b277e39366903ee72.js?file=calculatePathLength.js"></script>

      </div>
      <h2 class="mt-3">Tracing the path</h2>
      <p class="fs-5 my-5 text-start">
        This part was probably the most difficult part of the entire process.
        The tracer used <code>window.requestAnimationFrame()</code>, which
        allowed the code to detect the amount of time elapsed since the last
        frame to keep a consistent animation across performances. Again, the
        straight lines and corners were fairly straightforward, though the
        semicircle was not. The tracer, instead of simply being able to draw an
        arc, has to individually draw each point on the arc, which instantly
        becomes ten times more complicated.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/excalidraw_trace_semicircle.png" class="rounded" />

      <p class="fs-5 my-5 text-start">
        In order to get the position of the point (represented by
        <code>relX</code> and <code>relY</code> in the image), we first have to
        find angle ϴ, which can be found by taking the <em>total angle</em>, and
        subtracting from the same angle we used earlier - the arc tangent of the
        ratio of height over width (and vice versa). From there, it's as simple
        as <code>cos(ϴ) * radius</code> to solve for <code>relX</code> and
        <code>sin(ϴ) * radius</code> to solve for <code>relY</code>.
      </p>
